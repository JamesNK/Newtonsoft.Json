            Json.NET makes working with JSON formatted data in .NET
            simple. Quickly read and write JSON using LINQ to JSON or serialize
            your .NET objects with a single method call using the JsonSerializer.</p>
        <h3>
            Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flexible JSON serializer to convert .NET objects to JSON and back again</li>
            <li>LINQ to JSON for reading and writing JSON</li>
            <li>Writes indented, easy to read JSON</li>
            <li>Convert JSON to and from XML</li>
            <li>Supports Silverlight and the Compact Framework</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The JSON serializer is a good choice when the JSON you are reading or writing maps closely
        to a .NET class. The serializer automatically reads and writes JSON for the class.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            For situations where you are only interested in getting values from JSON, don&#39;t 
            have a class to serialize or deserialize to, or the JSON is radically different 
            from your class and you need to manually read and write from your objects then 
            LINQ to JSON is what you should use. LINQ to JSON allows you to easily read, 
            create and modify JSON in .NET.</p>
        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            Json.NET grew out of projects I was working on in late 2005 involving JavaScript,
            AJAX and .NET. At the time there were no libraries for working with JavaScript in
            .NET so I began to grow my own.</p>
        <p>
            Starting out as a couple of static methods for escaping JavaScript strings, Json.NET
            evolved as features were added. To add support for reading JSON a major refactor
            was required and Json.NET will split into the three major classes it still uses
            today, JsonReader, JsonWriter and JsonSerializer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Json.NET was first released in June 2006. Since then Json.NET has been downloaded
            thousands of times by developers and is used in a number of major projects open
            source projects including <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html" target="_blank">MonoRail</a>,
            Castle Project's MVC web framework, and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono</a>,
            an open source implementation
            of the .NET framework.</p>
