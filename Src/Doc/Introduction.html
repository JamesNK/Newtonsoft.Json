            Json.NET makes working with JSON formatted data in .NET
            simple. Quickly read and write JSON using LINQ to JSON or serialize
            your .NET objects with a single method call using the JsonSerializer.</p>
        <h3>
            Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>LINQ to JSON</li>
            <li>The JsonSerializer for quickly converting your .NET objects to JSON and back again</li>
            <li>Json.NET can optionally produce well formatted, indented JSON for debugging or display</li>
            <li>Attributes like JsonIgnore and JsonProperty can be added to a class to customize
                how a class is serialized</li>
            <li>Convert JSON to and from XML</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            History</h3>
        <p>
            Json.NET grew out of projects I was working on in late 2005 involving JavaScript,
            AJAX and .NET. At the time there were no libraries for working with JavaScript in
            .NET so I began to grow my own.</p>
        <p>
            Starting out as a couple of static methods for escaping JavaScript strings, Json.NET
            evolved as features were added. To add support for reading JSON a major refactor
            was required and Json.NET will split into the three major classes it still uses
            today, JsonReader, JsonWriter and JsonSerializer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Json.NET was first released in June 2006. Since then Json.NET has been downloaded
            thousands of times by developers and is used in a number of major projects open
            source projects including <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html" target="_blank">MonoRail</a>,
            Castle Project's MVC web framework, and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono</a>,
            an open source implementation
            of the .NET framework.</p>
