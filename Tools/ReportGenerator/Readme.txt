DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by PartCover, OpenCover
or NCover into a readable report in various formats. 
The reports do not only show the coverage quota, but also include the
source code and visualize which line has been covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one.
It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to
ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

The following output formats are supported by ReportGenerator:

-HTML, HTMLSummary
-XML, XMLSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary

Compatibility:

OpenCover
PartCover 4.0
PartCover 2.2, 2.3
Visual Studio (vstest.console.exe, CodeCoverage.exe)
NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)

Also available as NuGet package:
